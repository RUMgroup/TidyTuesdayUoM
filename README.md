## How it works

A social club with a bit of optional data visualisation homework.  
We create data visualisations in R from datasets published as part of the weekly TidyTuesday event.  
In our meetings we discuss the dataset, and a 2 - 3 people volunteer to present their code to the group. We then decide on which dataset to explore for the next meeting.  

We meet every 4 weeks on a Thursday 14:00 - 16:00, alternating between a hybrid meeting in Engineering Building A, and online.  
All levels of expertise welcome, the only proviso is that you are interested in creating visualisations with R.
